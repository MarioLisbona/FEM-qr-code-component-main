## My process
I created the outter QR code container and then nested 3 child div's for the image, title and information. I then created the styles, starting by resetting the body and set box sizing. Then styled the body and child div's with flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

i learned to use the max-width: 100% property to have the image fill 100% of the parent div.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp) - This helped me for to size the img to fill the entier parent div as the original image was too large.

- [Example resource 1](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/) - This course which i have recently completed helped with the css styling.
